# DriveSystem


## This program is a complete rewrite of the previous MicroROS drive system. Currently in Closed Alpha

Future Features:

* Individual Motor Control

* Inteligent Traction control
  
  * Realtime RPM/Power readouts from the motors back to the jetson

* Error Detection and correction

* Anything else the teams ask for.

This system is licenced under the MIT licence.


Note: The ArduinoNano (Our Microcontroller) has 6 PWM Pins: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11
